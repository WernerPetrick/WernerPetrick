## Hi there, I'm Werner! ðŸ‘‹
ðŸš€ Aspiring Full Stack Developer | Ruby on Rails | Python Enthuatist | Flutter-dabbler

I'm a self-taught coder who has been passionately diving into the world of technology.

My preferred technologies are Python, Ruby on Rails and MongoDB, I also use HTMX in my personal project. These technologies have captured my interest and I've been investing time and effort in mastering them.

Throughout my journey, I've always been inspired by the vast possibilities the internet offers. Growing up with dial-up and spending countless hours exploring websites, I witnessed the evolution of the internet firsthand. It's that evolution and the endless opportunities it presents that motivate me to pursue a career in technology.

When I'm not coding, you can often find me tinkering with my 3D printer, bringing my creative ideas to life. I'm also an avid consumer of technology-related content on platforms like YouTube, where I enjoy staying up to date with the latest trends, projects, and innovations in the coding community.
