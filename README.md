<p>
  I'm a self taught developer who is passionate about the world wide web.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout my journey, I've always been inspired by the vast possibilities the internet offers. Growing up with dial-up and spending countless hours exploring websites, I witnessed the evolution of the internet firsthand. It's that evolution and the endless opportunities it presents that motivate me to pursue a career in technology.
