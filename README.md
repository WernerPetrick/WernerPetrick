## Hi there, I'm Werner! ðŸ‘‹
ðŸš€ Aspiring Full Stack Developer | MEVN Enthusiast | Python Lover

I'm a self-taught coder who has been passionately diving into the world of technology for the past 3 months. While I don't have a professional background in the tech industry just yet, I've been dedicated to teaching myself coding and building a strong foundation in programming.

My preferred technologies revolve around the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js) and Python. These technologies have captured my interest and I've been investing time and effort in mastering them.

Throughout my journey, I've always been inspired by the vast possibilities the internet offers. Growing up with dial-up and spending countless hours exploring websites, I witnessed the evolution of the internet firsthand. It's that evolution and the endless opportunities it presents that motivate me to pursue a career in technology.

When I'm not coding, you can often find me tinkering with my 3D printer, bringing my creative ideas to life. I'm also an avid consumer of technology-related content on platforms like YouTube, where I enjoy staying up to date with the latest trends, projects, and innovations in the coding community.

I'm excited to continue my learning journey and collaborate with fellow tech enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect, collaborate, or discuss anything related to coding or technology!
